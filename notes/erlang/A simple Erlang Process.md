To understand the lifecycle and possible computations/executions of this Erlang.

### Process Spawning

The Erlang runtime system (ERTS) spawns a new process when it encounters a spawn instruction. This new process will execute the `proc/0` function. At this point, the process has its own execution context, separate from the process that spawned it.

### Execution of `proc/0`

The `proc/0` function consists of two `receive` blocks. The process will execute these blocks sequentially.

#### First `receive` Block

- The process enters a waiting state, where it looks for a message that matches the pattern `foo` in its mailbox.
- If a `foo` message is received, the process evaluates the body associated with the `foo` message, which is simply to evaluate to `true`. However, this result is not sent anywhere or stored, so it has no effect on subsequent computation.
- If no `foo` message is received, the process remains in the waiting state indefinitely until a `foo` message arrives. This is a blocking operation.

#### Second `receive` Block

- After processing the first `receive` block (assuming a `foo` message was received), the process moves to the next `receive` block.
- Similar to the first block, the process waits for a message that matches the pattern `bar`.
- Upon receiving a `bar` message, the process evaluates the body of this match, which again simply evaluates to `true` with no side effects.
- If no `bar` message is received, the process remains in the blocking state indefinitely until such a message arrives.

### Process Termination

- After executing the second `receive` block, assuming both `foo` and `bar` messages were received, the `proc/0` function reaches its end.
- Since there are no more instructions to execute, the process naturally terminates.
- Erlang's garbage collector will reclaim the memory used by the process. This happens automatically as Erlang uses a tracing garbage collector that is designed to work with its concurrency model.

### Possible Computations/Executions

1. **Receives `foo` then `bar`**: This is the straightforward path where the process waits, receives `foo`, then waits again and receives `bar` before terminating.
2. **Stuck waiting for `foo`**: If the process never receives a `foo` message, it will stay indefinitely in the waiting state at the first `receive` block.
3. **Receives `foo` but stuck waiting for `bar`**: If the process receives a `foo` message but never receives a `bar` message, it will stay indefinitely in the waiting state at the second `receive` block.
