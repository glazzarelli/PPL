In Racket, `pair?` and `list?` are predicates used to check whether a value is a pair or a list, respectively. The key differences between a pair and a list are:

- A pair (`pair?`) is a structure that combines exactly two values, which can be accessed using the `car` (first element) and `cdr` (second element) procedures. A pair does not necessarily have to be part of a list structure. A pair is created using the `cons` procedure. For instance, `(cons 1 2)` results in a pair, which is printed as `'(1 . 2)`.
- A list (`list?`), on the other hand, is a recursive data structure that is either the empty list (`null`) or a pair whose second value is also a list. Lists are typically created using the `list` function or by chaining `cons` procedures where the second part of each `cons` is either another `cons` or `null`. For example, `(cons 1 (cons 2 null))` results in a list of two elements: `'(1 2)`.

Additionally, it's important to note that in Racket, pairs are immutable. This means that once created, you cannot change the elements of a pair. There are mutable pairs as well, created using `mcons`, which can be modified with `set-mcar!` and `set-mcdr!`. Mutable pairs are not recognized by `pair?`, but by `mpair?`.

To check if something is a list, you can use the `list?` predicate. It will return `#t` (true) if the value is a list and `#f` (false) otherwise. For example:

```scheme
(list? '(1 2)) ; #t
(list? (cons 1 2)) ; #f because (cons 1 2) is a pair, not a proper list
```

In summary, `pair?` checks for a structure composed of exactly two elements, while `list?` checks for a proper list, which may be composed of multiple pairs linked together in a way that forms a sequence ending with `null`.

In Racket, you can use the `pair?` predicate to check if a list has at least one element. Lists in Racket are made up of concatenated pairs, where each pair contains an element and a reference to the next pair or `null` to indicate the end of the list. If a value is a pair, it has at least one element (the `car` of the pair), and potentially more if the `cdr` of the pair is another pair or `null`.

To check if a list has at least one element, you can use `pair?` as follows:

```scheme
(pair? lst) ; returns #t if lst is non-empty (i.e., has at least one element)
```

However, if you want to specifically check if a list has exactly one element, you can use a combination of `pair?` and `null?` to check if the `cdr` of the list is `null`, which would mean the list has only one element:

```scheme
(and (pair? lst) (null? (cdr lst))) ; returns #t if lst has exactly one element
```

This approach is mentioned in [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43335524/how-do-i-check-my-list-to-see-if-it-contains-only-one-value-or-more-than-one), where the provided `swap` function includes a condition to check if the list has a single element by verifying if the `cdr` of the list is `null`. 

The Racket documentation in [Source 1](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html) provides examples of how `pair?` returns `#t` for both proper lists and improper lists (i.e., pairs that are not terminated by `null`). It's important to note that `pair?` will return `#t` for any pair, whether or not it is part of a list structure. 

In summary, `pair?` can be used to check if a list has at least one element, as any non-empty list in Racket will begin with a pair. If you want to check for a list with exactly one element, you should check if the `cdr` of that pair is `null`.
