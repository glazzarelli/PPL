In Scheme, a `let` expression allows you to bind variables to values in a local scope. When you nest `let` expressions with the same variable names, each `let` creates a new, separate scope for its bindings. This means that the inner `let` can shadow or override the bindings from an outer `let` if they use the same variable names. The most locally scoped variable (i.e., the one in the innermost `let`) takes precedence within its scope.

Here's how it works in detail:

1. **Outer `let` Binding**: When you define a variable in an outer `let`, it is accessible within that `let`'s body, including any expressions or nested `let` expressions.

2. **Inner `let` Shadowing**: If an inner `let` defines a variable with the same name as one in an outer `let`, the inner `let`'s binding shadows or hides the outer one within its scope. Access to the outer variable of the same name is blocked within the inner `let`'s scope.

3. **Scope Resolution**: When accessing a variable, Scheme looks for the closest scope where the variable is defined. This means that within the inner `let`, the variable's value is what was bound in that `let`, ignoring any outer bindings with the same name.

### Example

Consider the following example:

```scheme
(let ((x 5)) ; Outer let binding x to 5
  (display x) ; Displays 5
  (let ((x 10)) ; Inner let binding x to 10, shadowing outer x
    (display x)) ; Displays 10, because inner x shadows outer x
  (display x)) ; Displays 5 again, because we're back in outer let's scope
```

In this example:

- The first `(display x)` prints `5`, using the binding from the outer `let`.
- The second `(display x)` inside the inner `let` prints `10`, because the inner `let`'s binding for `x` shadows the outer one.
- The third `(display x)`, after the inner `let`, prints `5` again, because the scope of the inner `let` (and its shadowing of `x`) no longer applies.

### Conclusion

Nesting `let` expressions with the same variable names in Scheme creates separate scopes for each `let`, with inner scopes able to shadow outer ones. This feature can be useful for temporary calculations or reusing variable names without affecting outer scopes, but it requires careful management to avoid confusion or errors due to shadowing.
