The difference between `'(addOne addOne addOne)` and `(list addOne addOne addOne)` in Racket is that the former is a list of symbols, while the latter is a list of function objects.

- `'(addOne addOne addOne)` is a quoted list, which means everything inside is treated as literal data, not as code to be executed. It contains three symbols, each of which is the name `addOne`, but not the function `addOne` itself.

- `(list addOne addOne addOne)` is a call to the `list` function that constructs a new list out of its arguments. In this case, because `addOne` is not quoted, it refers to the function object defined earlier. Thus, this expression creates a list containing three references to the same function `addOne`.

When you try to apply `(car l)` where `l` is `'(addOne addOne addOne)`, you are trying to call the symbol `addOne` as if it were a function, which does not work. However, if `l` is `(list addOne addOne addOne)`, `(car l)` correctly refers to the function `addOne`, and `((car l) 1)` will successfully apply the `addOne` function to `1`.

Another way is to use `quasiquote` (backquote) and `unquote` (comma) to create a list of functions in Racket. The `quasiquote` allows for parts of the expression to be evaluated, while the rest is treated as a literal. You can use `unquote` within a `quasiquote` to include evaluated expressions (like function names without quotes). Here's how you can rewrite your list `l` using `quasiquote` and `unquote`:

```scheme
(define addOne
  (lambda (x)
    (+ 1 x)))
(define l `(,addOne ,addOne ,addOne))
((car l) 1)
```

In the above code:
- The backquote `` ` `` starts a `quasiquote` expression.
- The commas `,` before `addOne` are `unquote` operators that evaluate `addOne` and include the function itself (not the symbol) in the list.

This way, `l` is a list of the function `addOne` repeated three times, and `((car l) 1)` will correctly apply the `addOne` function to `1`, resulting in `2` [Source 2](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/quasiquote.html).
