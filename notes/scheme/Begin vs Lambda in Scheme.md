The `(begin e1 ...)` syntax and the `(lambda () e1 ...)` syntax in Racket serve different purposes and behave differently:

- `(begin e1 ...)` is a sequencing form that evaluates each expression `e1`, `e2`, etc., in order and returns the value of the last expression. It is typically used to sequence side effects or to group multiple expressions where only the value of the last one is needed [Source 0](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/begin.html).

- `(lambda () e1 ...)` creates an anonymous function that takes no arguments and, when called, evaluates the expressions `e1`, `e2`, etc., in the function's body, returning the value of the last expression. The lambda expression itself doesn't evaluate the expressions until the function it defines is invoked [Source 1](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/lambda.html).

Here's a key difference: `begin` executes immediately, while `lambda` creates a function that must be called to execute. If you want to delay the execution of a sequence of expressions, you would use a lambda. If you want to execute them immediately, you would use `begin`.

Given the code snippet:
```scheme
((displayln (+ x y))
 (displayln (* x y))
 (displayln (* z z)))
```
This is not valid syntax as it stands because the outermost parentheses suggest a function call with three arguments, each of which is a function call to `displayln`. However, these inner expressions do not return a function, so this would result in an error.

If you wish to execute these expressions sequentially, you would use `begin`:
```scheme
(begin
 (displayln (+ x y))
 (displayln (* x y))
 (displayln (* z z)))
```
This will execute each `displayln` call in order and return the result of the last expression (which in the case of `displayln` is `#<void>` because `displayln` is used for its side effect of printing to the console, not for the value it returns).

On the other hand, wrapping the expressions in a `lambda` would create a function that, when called, executes the expressions:
```scheme
(lambda ()
 (displayln (+ x y))
 (displayln (* x y))
 (displayln (* z z)))
```
To execute the above, you would need to call the function:
```scheme
((lambda ()
 (displayln (+ x y))
 (displayln (* x y))
 (displayln (* z z))))
```
The double parentheses at the beginning indicate a function call to the anonymous function created by `lambda`.
