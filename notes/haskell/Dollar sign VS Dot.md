The `$` and `.` operators in Haskell are used for function application and composition, respectively. 

The `$` operator is used for function application. It is a way of avoiding parentheses. Instead of writing `f (g x)`, you can write `f $ g x`. The `$` operator applies the function on its left to the argument on its right. It has the lowest precedence, which means it is often used to avoid parentheses in expressions with multiple function calls [Source 1](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids).

Here is an example:

```haskell
print $ 3 + 2  -- This will print 5
```

The `.` operator is used for function composition. The expression `(f . g) x` is equivalent to `f (g x)`. It applies the function `g` to `x` and then applies the function `f` to the result. This operator is useful when you want to create a new function by combining existing ones [Source 1](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids).

Here is an example:

```haskell
let f = (+1) . (*2)
f 5  -- This will return 11
```

In the provided code snippet, the `$` operator is used in the definition of the `Applicative` instance for `BTree`. The line `fs <*> xs = btconcatMap (\f -> fmap f xs) fs` applies the function `f` to `xs` for each function `f` in `fs`, and then concatenates the results. This could not be done using the `.` operator because the `fmap` function needs to be applied to `xs` for each `f`.

In the commented out line `-- btconcatMap :: (a -> b) -> BTree a -> [b]`, the `.` operator is used for function composition. The expression `btconcat . btmap f` would create a new function that maps `f` over a `BTree` and then concatenates the results. This is different from the `btconcatMap` function defined with `$`, which applies `f` to each element of the `BTree` and then concatenates the results.
