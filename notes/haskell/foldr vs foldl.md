In Haskell, `foldr` and `foldl` are both higher-order functions that reduce a data structure to a single value. The choice between `foldr` and `foldl` depends on the nature of the data structure and the operation being performed.

`foldr` is generally preferred for two main reasons:

1. **Laziness**: `foldr` is lazy, meaning it can handle infinite lists. This is due to Haskell's call-by-need evaluation strategy. In this strategy, expressions are not evaluated until their results are needed. `foldr` can take advantage of this laziness, as it only evaluates the part of the list that is needed to compute the final result [5](https://gist.github.com/CMCDragonkai/9f5f75118dda10131764).

2. **Preserving Order**: `foldr` preserves the order of the list, which is often desirable. This is particularly important when transforming lists into other lists with related elements in the same order [1](https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldr_Foldl_Foldl').

However, there are cases where `foldl` may be more appropriate. For example, if the list is large but finite, and the combining function is commutative (i.e., the order of the arguments does not matter), `foldl` can offer better performance than `foldr` [1](https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldr_Foldl_Foldl').

It's also worth noting that `foldl'` is a strict version of `foldl` that can avoid stack overflows by forcing the evaluation of the initial parameter before making the recursive call. This makes `foldl'` more efficient when lazy evaluation of the final result is impossible or undesirable [2](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Fold).

Here is a simple example to illustrate the difference between `foldr` and `foldl`:

```haskell
let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- foldr example
foldr (+) 0 xs -- result: 15

-- foldl example
foldl (+) 0 xs -- result: 15
```

In this case, both `foldr` and `foldl` produce the same result. However, if the combining function is not commutative, the order in which elements are processed can affect the result. For example:

```haskell
let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- foldr example
foldr (-) 0 xs -- result: 3

-- foldl example
foldl (-) 0 xs -- result: -15
```


In this case, `foldr` subtracts each element from the initial value, resulting in a negative number, while `foldl` subtracts the initial value from each element, resulting in a positive number [6](https://www.davidculley.com/blog/haskells-foldl-and-foldr-explained/).

This expands as follows:

```haskell
= 1 - foldr (-) 0 [2, 3, 4, 5]
= 1 - (2 - foldr (-) 0 [3, 4, 5])
= 1 - (2 - (3 - foldr (-) 0 [4, 5]))
= 1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - foldr (-) 0 [5])))
= 1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - (5 - foldr (-) 0 []))))
= 1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - (5 - 0))))
= 3
```

```haskell
= foldl (-) (0 - 1) [2, 3, 4, 5]
= foldl (-) (-1 - 2) [3, 4, 5]
= foldl (-) (-3 - 3) [4, 5]
= foldl (-) (-6 - 4) [5]
= foldl (-) (-10 - 5) []
= -15
```
In this case, `foldl` and `foldr` produce different results because the order of operations is different. `foldr` applies the binary function to the first element and the result of folding the rest of the structure, while `foldl` applies the binary function to the result of folding all but the last element and the last element itself [2](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Fold).
