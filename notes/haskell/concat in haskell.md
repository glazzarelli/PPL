In Haskell, `concat` is a function that flattens a list of lists into a single list by concatenating all the sublists. It has the type signature `concat :: [[a]] -> [a]`, indicating that it takes a list of lists of any type `a` and returns a list of type `a`.

Here are some examples of how `concat` works:

- `concat [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], []]` will result in `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.
- `concat (Just [1, 2, 3])` will result in `[1,2,3]` because `Just` here is treated as a single-element list containing the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `concat (Left 42)` will result in `[]` because `Left 42` is treated as an empty list since it doesn't contain a list.
- `concat []` will give you an empty list `[]` as there are no elements to concatenate.

It's important to note that `concat` can also be used with types other than lists, such as `ByteString`, `Text`, `Vector`, and `DList`, as long as they implement the `Foldable` typeclass, which allows them to be concatenated. The behavior of `concat` may vary slightly based on the type it is operating on, but the general idea is that it combines a collection of elements into a single concatenated element of the same type.

For example:
- `concat :: [ByteString] -> ByteString` concatenates a list of `ByteString`s.
- `concat :: [Text] -> Text` concatenates a list of `Text` values.
- `concat :: [Vector a] -> Vector a` concatenates a list of `Vector`s containing elements of type `a`.

The `concat` function is part of the `Prelude` module, which is automatically imported in Haskell programs, so you can use it without needing to import anything else. [Source 0](https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=concat)
