In Haskell, `(-1)` and `(1-)` represent different concepts due to the nature of prefix and infix operators.

`(-1)` is a prefix operation that negates the value `1`. It's a special case in Haskell; it is the only prefix operator in the language. When you write `(-1)`, you get "negative one" which is a number [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9504420/haskell-what-is-the-difference-between-1-and-x-x1).

On the other hand, `(1-)` is an infix operation that represents a function that subtracts `1` from its argument. This is an anonymous function that takes a number `x` and returns `x - 1` [Source 3](https://wiki.haskell.org/Anonymous_function).

Here is how you can use both in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Using (-1)
let a = (-1) * 5 -- a will be -5

-- Using (1-)
let b = (1-) 5 -- b will be -4
```

In the first line, `(-1)` is used to multiply `-1` with `5`, resulting in `-5`. In the second line, `(1-)` is used as a function that subtracts `1` from `5`, resulting in `4`.

If you want to define a `subtractOne` function that subtracts one from its argument, you would define it like this in Haskell:

```haskell
subtractOne :: Num a => a -> a
subtractOne x = x - 1
```

Here's what's happening in the code above:

- `subtractOne :: Num a => a -> a` is the type signature for the function. It says that `subtractOne` is a function that takes one argument of any type that is an instance of the `Num` type class (which includes all standard numeric types like `Int`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`, etc.) and returns a value of the same type.

- `subtractOne x = x - 1` is the function definition. It takes an input `x` and subtracts `1` from it.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use operator sections, you can also define `subtractOne` like this:

```haskell
subtractOne :: Num a => a -> a
subtractOne = subtract 1
```

Or even more succinctly:

```haskell
subtractOne :: Num a => a -> a
subtractOne = (1-)
```

In the second and third versions, `subtractOne` is defined as a partially applied subtraction function. The `(1-)` is a section that creates a new function that subtracts its argument from `1`, effectively achieving the same result as the explicitly written function `subtractOne x = x - 1`.
