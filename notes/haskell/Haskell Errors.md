The Haskell error message you're seeing indicates a type mismatch in your `gtree2list` function. Specifically, Haskell cannot match the type `a` with the type `[a]`. This is because in the list comprehension within the `gtree2list` function, you're trying to concatenate a list of `a` with a list of lists of `a`.

Here is the problematic part in your code:

```haskell
gtree2list (GTree v trees) = [v] ++ [(gtree2list t) | t <- trees]
```

The list comprehension `[(gtree2list t) | t <- trees]` produces a list of lists because `gtree2list t` returns a list for each `t`. When you try to concatenate `[v]` (which is a list containing a single element of type `a`) with a list of lists (each element being `[a]`), you get a type mismatch.

To fix this error, you need to concatenate all the lists together. You can use the `concat` function to flatten the list of lists into a single list, or you can use the `concatMap` function which maps a function over a list and then concatenates the results.

Here's a corrected version of your `gtree2list` function using `concatMap`:

```haskell
gtree2list :: GTree a -> [a]
gtree2list TNil = []
gtree2list (GTree v trees) = v : concatMap gtree2list trees
```

This function works as follows:

- For the `TNil` case, it returns an empty list.
- For the `GTree v trees` case, it creates a new list with `v` as the head followed by the flattened list of results from applying `gtree2list` to each subtree in `trees`.

Using `:` instead of `++` for adding the head element `v` is more efficient because `:` has constant time complexity, whereas `++` has linear time complexity relative to the length of its first argument.

This function will now correctly convert a general tree into a list by performing a depth-first traversal.
